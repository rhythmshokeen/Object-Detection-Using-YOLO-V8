# Object-Detection-Using-YOLO-V8
This project uses the YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once) deep learning model to perform real-time object detection using your webcam. Built with Python and OpenCV, it detects 80+ common objects from the COCO dataset and displays bounding boxes, class labels, and confidence scores live on the video feed.
